POSSIBLE IDEA FOR MAKING AN INSTALLER WITH EXECUTABLE:

> use same logic in app.sh for manipulating terminal commands (copy/move files, creating/activating virtual environments, creating symbolic link)
> gui that will get installation location
> installer file contains the downloader project folder, script that will operate installer, installer gui program
> compiled in zip file
> refer to "EXECUTABLE MUSIC DOWNLOADER" thread in ChatGPT for reference
